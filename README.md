# Project-2: Farmers Markets in the United States 

**Team:** Raul Haro, Alexandra Oricchio, Eli Payne

**Project Description:** For our project, we used United States farmers markets data from data.gov to create an interactive web dashboard. The dataset includes metrics for market name and location, payment types accepted, and available products. Our dashboard includes an interactive map and bar chart, presenting our data in different visualizations. 
Our first visual is a choropleth map of the United States which displays the farmers markets per 100,000 per state based on a color scale. The darker the state, the more markets per 100,000. If you hover over a specific state on the map, the information box in the bottom left corner of the map will display the number of total markets in the state and the number of markets per 100,000 in the state. 
To the left of our map is a drop-down selector for state. When a state is selected, our map zooms into that state and displays markers for each farmers market location within the state. Additionally, a list of the stateâ€™s markets by name populates in the left sidebar. When a market name within the state markets list is clicked, the market information box located in the left sidebar populates with the markets name, city, street, season and hours of operation. 
Our second visual is a bar chart which displays the number of markets each product is available at. This bar chart responds to the state dropdown selection as well. When a state is selected, the bar chart populates with data specific to the chosen state.
